### Rules

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where 2 players attempt to draw 3 of their icons in a row. If the grid is completely filled, with nobody gaining 3 in a row, the game is considered a draw.

### Technologies

This game was developed using a mixture of HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.

### Development

-I started planning in a text document, writing down the problemds I would face in the relevant technologies.

- The HTML was very straight forward, and I didn't run in to any problems until the styling and the development of the actual game functionallity.
